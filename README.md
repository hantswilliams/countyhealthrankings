## minor changes 
- to make the data more readible (specifically County Health Rankings - sheet name: Outcomes & Factors SubRankings) decided to fix the first two rows so there is only one row of heads, versus two, and simplified the names there for easier matching/merging 

## County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) is a program of the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.

- The CHR&R program provides data, evidence, guidance, and examples to build awareness of the multiple factors that influence health and support leaders in growing community power to improve health equity. The Rankings are unique in their ability to measure the health of nearly every county in all 50 states, and are complemented by guidance, tools, and resources designed to accelerate community learning and action. CHR&R is known for effectively translating and communicating complex data and evidence-informed policy into accessible models, reports, and products that deepen the understanding of what makes communities healthy and inspires and supports improvement efforts. County Health Rankings & Roadmapsâ€™ work is rooted in a sincere belief in health equity, the idea that everyone deserves a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
